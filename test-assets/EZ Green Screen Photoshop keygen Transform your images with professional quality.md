If you want to create stunning photos with realistic backgrounds, you might want to try using a green screen technique. A green screen is a technique where you photograph your subject in front of a green background and then replace the background with another image using a software. This way, you can create photos that look like they were taken in different locations or scenarios.

However, using a green screen can be tricky and time-consuming. You need to have a good lighting setup, a smooth and even green background, and a software that can extract your subject from the green background without leaving any traces or artifacts.

## How to Install EZ Green Screen Plugin
 
To install EZ Green Screen plugin, you need to download it from the official website: https://ezgreenscreen.com/. You can either purchase the full version or download the trial version for free. The trial version has some limitations but it still allows you to test the plugin and see how it works.
 
After downloading the plugin, you need to unzip it and copy the folder called "EZGreenScreen" into your Photoshop plugins folder. The location of this folder may vary depending on your operating system and Photoshop version, but it's usually something like this:
 
C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CC 2022\Plug-ins
 
Once you have copied the folder, you need to restart Photoshop and activate the plugin. To do this, go to Window > Extensions > EZGreenScreen. A new panel will appear on your screen with the plugin interface.
 
## How to Use EZ Green Screen Plugin to Extract Your Subject from the Green Background
 
To use EZ Green Screen plugin to extract your subject from the green background, you need to have two images: one with your subject in front of a green background and one with the background that you want to replace it with. You can use any image format that Photoshop supports, such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc.
 
First, open both images in Photoshop and make sure they have the same size and resolution. You can use Image > Image Size or Image > Canvas Size to adjust them if needed. Then, drag and drop the image with your subject onto the image with your background. This will create a new layer with your subject on top of your background.
 
Next, select the layer with your subject and go to Window > Extensions > EZGreenScreen. The plugin panel will open on your screen. Here, you will see several options and sliders that you can use to control how the plugin extracts your subject from the green background.
 
The first option is called "Extraction Mode". This allows you to choose between two modes: "Auto" or "Manual". The Auto mode will automatically detect and remove the green background from your image using an advanced algorithm. The Manual mode will let you select the green color range manually using a color picker tool.
 
We recommend using the Auto mode for most cases, as it usually gives good results without much tweaking. However, if you have a complex or uneven green background, or if you want more control over the extraction process

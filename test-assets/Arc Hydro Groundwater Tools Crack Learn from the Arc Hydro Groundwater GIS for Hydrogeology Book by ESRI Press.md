# How to Download and Use Arc Hydro Groundwater Tools for ArcGIS
 
Arc Hydro Groundwater Tools is a set of extensions for ArcGIS that allows you to display, analyze and archive groundwater and subsurface data. It is based on the Arc Hydro Groundwater data model, which is a standard framework for organizing and managing groundwater data within a geodatabase. With Arc Hydro Groundwater Tools, you can:
 
- Delineate and characterize watersheds in raster and vector formats
- Define and analyze hydrogeometric networks
- Manage time series data
- Export data to numerical models
- Create and visualize 2D and 3D geologic models
- Edit, archive and visualize MODFLOW models

In this article, we will show you how to download and use Arc Hydro Groundwater Tools for ArcGIS 10 or ArcGIS Pro. You will need a Basic level or higher license of ArcGIS Desktop or ArcGIS Pro, as well as ESRI's 3D Analyst and Spatial Analyst extensions.

## Installing Arc Hydro Groundwater Tools
 
To install Arc Hydro Groundwater Tools, you need to extract the zip archive and run the setup.exe file. The setup wizard will guide you through the installation process. You will need to accept the license agreement, choose the installation folder, and select the components you want to install. The components include:

- Arc Hydro Groundwater Core: The core functionality of the tools, such as data model creation, data import/export, time series management, etc.
- Groundwater Analyst: A tool for importing, managing, mapping and plotting groundwater data, such as wells, time series, cross sections, etc.
- Subsurface Analyst: A tool for creating and visualizing 2D and 3D geologic models, such as boreholes, cross sections, geosections and geovolumes.
- MODFLOW Analyst: A tool for editing, archiving and visualizing MODFLOW models within ArcMap.

You can choose to install all or some of the components depending on your needs. After the installation is complete, you will need to enable .NET support in ArcGIS if it is not already enabled. To do this, go to Customize > Extensions in ArcMap or Project > Options > Extensions in ArcGIS Pro and check the box next to .NET Support.
 
## Using Arc Hydro Groundwater Tools
 
To use Arc Hydro Groundwater Tools, you need to activate them in ArcMap or ArcGIS Pro. To do this, go to Customize > Toolbars in ArcMap or View > Add-In Manager in ArcGIS Pro and check the boxes next to the tools you want to use. You will see new toolbars appear on your interface that contain various buttons and menus for accessing the tools' functions.
 
The first step to use Arc Hydro Groundwater Tools is to create a new geodatabase or open an existing one that follows the Arc Hydro Groundwater data model. You can do this by clicking on the Create AHGW Geodatabase button on the AHGW Core toolbar. You will need to specify a name and location for your geodatabase, as well as a spatial reference system.
 
Once you have a geodatabase ready, you can start importing your groundwater and subsurface data into it using the tools' import functions. For example, you can use the Import Wells button on the Groundwater Analyst toolbar to import well data from various formats (such as shapefiles, Excel files, text files, etc.) into your geodatabase. You can also use the Import Time Series button on the same toolbar to import time series data (such as

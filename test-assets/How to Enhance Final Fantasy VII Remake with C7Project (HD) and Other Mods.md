Final Fantasy VII is widely regarded as one of the best and most influential games of all time, winning numerous awards and accolades, and selling over 13 million copies worldwide. The game is praised for its rich and complex story, memorable characters, innovative gameplay systems, and groundbreaking use of 3D graphics and cinematic cutscenes. The game also spawned a multimedia franchise, including sequels, prequels, spin-offs, movies, novels, and more.
 
However, despite its popularity and legacy, Final Fantasy VII has not aged well in terms of graphics and gameplay. The game was originally designed for the PlayStation 1 console, which had limited hardware capabilities and low-resolution graphics. The game also suffers from some technical issues, such as bugs, glitches, translation errors, and compatibility problems with modern operating systems and devices.
 
That's why a group of passionate fans have decided to take matters into their own hands and create a fan-made remake of the game, called Final Fantasy VII - C7Project (HD). The mod aims to update and enhance the game with modern technology and features, while staying true to the original vision and spirit of the game. The mod is not intended to replace or compete with the official remake of Final Fantasy VII by Square Enix, which was released in 2020 for PlayStation 4 and will be released in 2021 for PlayStation 5.

- New content: The mod includes new content that was not present in the original game or was cut during development. For example, the mod adds new scenes, dialogues, characters, enemies, items, weapons, side quests, minigames, secrets, easter eggs, and more.

Final Fantasy VII - C7Project (HD) is a work in progress and is not yet complete. The mod is divided into several chapters that correspond to the original discs of the game.

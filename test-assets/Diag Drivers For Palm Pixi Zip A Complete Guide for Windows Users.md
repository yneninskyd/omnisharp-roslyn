## Step 1: Download the diag drivers
 
The diag drivers for Palm Pixi Plus are available in pack 5 of FuriouSGold software, which is a tool for unlocking and flashing various mobile phones. You can download pack 5 from the FuriouSGold website or from this Google Drive link[^3^]. The file name is Qualcomm Diag Driver.rar and it is about 6 MB in size.
 
## Step 2: Extract the diag drivers
 
After downloading the diag drivers, you need to extract them using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get a folder called Qualcomm Diag Driver with several files inside. You can extract the folder to any location on your computer, such as your desktop or your documents folder.
 
## Step 3: Connect your phone to your computer
 
Before installing the diag drivers, you need to connect your Palm Pixi Plus phone to your computer using a USB cable. Make sure your phone is turned on and in passthru mode. To enter passthru mode, you need to type ##3424# on your phone's dial pad and press call. You will see a message saying "Passthru Enabled".
 
## Step 4: Install the diag drivers
 
Once your phone is connected and in passthru mode, you need to install the diag drivers on your computer. To do that, follow these steps:
 
- Go to Start > Control Panel > System > Hardware > Device Manager.
- Look for a device called [beezl] Palm Pixi Passthru Diag Port (COM3) with a yellow exclamation mark next to it. This means that the device is not recognized by your computer.
- Right-click on the device and select Update Driver.
- Select No, not this time when asked if you want to connect to Windows Update.
- Select Install from a list or specific location (Advanced).
- Select Don't search. I will choose the driver to install.
- Select Have Disk and browse to the folder where you extracted the diag drivers.
- Select Qualcomm CDMA Technologies MSM and click Next.
- Click Continue Anyway when prompted by Windows XP.
- Click Finish when the installation is complete.

## Step 5: Verify the installation
 
To verify that the diag drivers are installed correctly, you can check the Device Manager again. You should see [beezl] Palm Pixi Passthru Diag Port (COM3) under Ports (COM & LPT) without any yellow exclamation mark. You can also check the properties of the device and see that it is using driver version 2.0.3.9 from Qualcomm Incorporated.

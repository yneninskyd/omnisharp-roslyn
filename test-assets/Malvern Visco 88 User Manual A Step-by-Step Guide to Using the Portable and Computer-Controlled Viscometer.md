The Malvern Visco 88 is a portable, easy-to-use viscometer that can measure the viscosity of liquids in laboratory, plant and field settings. It can operate as a standalone device or connect to a computer running the Bohlin software for more advanced features and data analysis. This article will guide you through the basic steps of using the Malvern Visco 88 viscometer.
 
## What You Need
 
To use the Malvern Visco 88 viscometer, you will need the following items:
 
**Download ○○○ [https://searchdisvipas.blogspot.com/?download=2uyaiE](https://searchdisvipas.blogspot.com/?download=2uyaiE)**


 
- The Visco 88 instrument
- A power supply unit
- A measuring system (spindle and chamber)
- A sample of liquid to measure
- A thermometer (optional)
- A computer with the Bohlin software installed (optional)
- A USB cable (optional)

## How to Set Up the Instrument
 
Follow these steps to set up the Malvern Visco 88 viscometer:

1. Place the instrument on a flat, stable surface.
2. Connect the power supply unit to the instrument and plug it into a power outlet.
3. Turn on the instrument by pressing the power button on the front panel.
4. Select the desired language and units from the menu on the display.
5. Attach the measuring system to the instrument by aligning the pins and sockets on the spindle and chamber.
6. Calibrate the instrument by following the instructions on the display.

## How to Measure Viscosity
 
Follow these steps to measure viscosity using the Malvern Visco 88 viscometer:

1. Fill the chamber with enough sample liquid to cover the spindle.
2. If using a thermometer, insert it into the chamber and record the temperature of the sample.
3. Select a rotational speed from the menu on the display. The speed should be chosen based on the expected viscosity range of the sample. Refer to the user manual[^1^] [^2^] for more details on choosing a rotational speed.
4. Press the start button on the front panel to begin measuring.
5. The instrument will display the torque, viscosity and shear rate values on the screen. You can also view a graph of torque versus time by pressing the graph button.
6. Press the stop button to end measuring.
7. If using a computer, connect it to the instrument using a USB cable and launch the Bohlin software. You can transfer, process and display data from the instrument using this software. Refer to the user manual[^1^] [^2^] for more details on using this software.

# How to Download and Install HP LaserJet M1136 MFP Driver for Ubuntu
 
If you have an HP LaserJet M1136 MFP printer and you want to use it with your Ubuntu system, you may need to download and install the driver software for it. The driver software allows your computer to communicate with your printer and perform various functions such as printing, scanning, copying, and faxing. In this article, we will show you how to download and install the HP LaserJet M1136 MFP driver for Ubuntu in a few simple steps.

## Step 1: Check Your Printer Model and Operating System
 
Before you download and install the driver software, you need to make sure that you have the correct printer model and operating system. To check your printer model, you can look at the front or back of your printer, or on the printer's control panel. You should see a label that says "HP LaserJet Pro M1136 MFP" or something similar.
 
To check your operating system, you can open a terminal window and type `lsb_release -a` and press Enter. You should see some information about your Ubuntu version, such as the codename, release number, and architecture. For example, you may see something like this:

    Distributor ID: Ubuntu
    Description:    Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS
    Release:        20.04
    Codename:       focal
    Architecture:   x86_64

Note down your Ubuntu codename and architecture, as you will need them later.
 
## Step 2: Download the Driver Software from HP Website
 
Next, you need to download the driver software from the HP website. To do this, you can follow these steps:
 
1. Open a web browser and go to [https://support.hp.com/in-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-laserjet-pro-m1136-multifunction-printer-series/5094778](https://support.hp.com/in-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-laserjet-pro-m1136-multifunction-printer-series/5094778). This is the official HP support page for your printer model[^1^] [^2^].
2. On the page, you will see a section that says "Software and drivers for HP LaserJet Pro M1136 Multifunction Printer series". Under that section, you will see a drop-down menu that says "Detected operating system". Click on it and select "Choose a different OS".
3. A new window will pop up that says "Select your operating system". Under that window, you will see two drop-down menus: one for "Operating system" and one for "Version". Click on the first one and select "Linux". Then click on the second one and select your Ubuntu codename (for example, "focal"). Then click on "Change".
4. The page will refresh and show you a list of available driver software for your printer and operating system. You will see a section that says "Driver-Product Installation Software". Under that section, you will see a file that says "HP LaserJet Pro M1136 Full Feature Software and Driver". This is the file that you need to download. Click on the blue "Download" button next to it.
5. A new window will pop up that says "Save As". Choose a location where you want to save the file (for example, your Downloads folder) and click on "Save". The file will start downloading. It may take some time depending on your internet speed.

## Step 3: Install the Driver Software on Your Ubuntu System
 
Once the file is downloaded, you need to install it on your Ubuntu system. To do this, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the location where you saved the file (for example, your Downloads folder). You can use the `cd` command to change directories. For example, if you saved the file in your Downloads folder, you can type `cd ~/Downloads` and press Enter.
2. List the contents of the directory using the `ls` command. You should see the file that you downloaded. It should have a name like `hplip

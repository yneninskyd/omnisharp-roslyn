## How to Use Autodesk Inventor CAM (HSM) Ultimate 2020 x64
  
Using Autodesk Inventor CAM (HSM) Ultimate 2020 x64 is easy and intuitive, thanks to its CAD-embedded interface and workflow. Here are the basic steps to create and edit CAM data in Inventor:

1. **Open or create a part or assembly file in Inventor**: You can use any of the modeling and design tools in Inventor to create your part or assembly, or you can import an existing file from another CAD software.
2. **Switch to the CAM environment**: You can access the CAM environment from the ribbon menu or the browser panel. You will see a new set of tabs and panels that contain the CAM tools and commands.
3. **Create a setup**: A setup defines the orientation, origin, and stock of your part or assembly. You can create multiple setups for different machining operations or workpieces.
4. **Create toolpaths**: A toolpath is a sequence of movements that a cutting tool follows to remove material from the workpiece. You can create toolpaths for different types of operations, such as facing, pocketing, drilling, contouring, etc. You can also edit the parameters and options of each toolpath, such as tool selection, feed rate, stepover, etc.
5. **Simulate and verify toolpaths**: You can use the simulation tools to preview and check your toolpaths before sending them to the machine. You can see the material removal, tool motion, and potential collisions in a realistic 3D view. You can also measure distances, angles, and volumes in the simulation.
6. **Post process toolpaths**: You can generate NC code for your toolpaths using the post processing tools. You can select from a list of built-in or custom post processors that support various CNC machines and formats. You can also edit and preview the NC code in a text editor.
7. **Save and share CAM data**: You can save your CAM data as part of your Inventor file or as a separate file. You can also store your CAM data on the cloud using Autodesk Drive or Fusion 360 Team, and share them with your team members or clients for easy collaboration and access.

With these simple steps, you can create and edit CAM data in Inventor using Autodesk Inventor CAM (HSM) Ultimate 2020 x64. You can also use the online help and tutorials to learn more about the software and its features.
